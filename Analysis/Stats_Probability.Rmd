This video gives a broad introduction to probability distributions. Dr. Gotelli discusses the ranges, parameters, and interpretations of discrete distributions (Poisson, binomial, negative binomial) and continuous distributions (uniform, normal, gamma, and beta). He also gives a brief introduction to the probability distribution functions and their grammar in R.
