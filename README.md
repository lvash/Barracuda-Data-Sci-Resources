# Barracuda Data Science Resources

Barracuda is a research project funded by a National Science Foundation EPSCoR grant, and is a collaboration between two research groups at the University of Maine (UM) and the University of Vermont (UVM). Barracuda stands for “Biodiversity and Rural Response to Climate Change Using Data Analysis.” See https://biobarracuda.org/ for more information about the research we are working on. This repository compiles resources from multiple disciplines and institutions to present an all-in-one website for learning data science and programming methods.
